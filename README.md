# The Canonical Table of Congruity

This repository is intentionally conservative, minimal, and closed by design.

*Canonical layers of Congruity: admissibility grammar → projections → domain implementations.*

This repository defines the **canonical structural grammar of Congruity**.

Congruity is not a model, an algorithm, or an application framework.  
It is a structural law describing **admissible transformations** in complex systems.

The Canonical Table formalizes Congruity as a minimal, finite lattice of proportional states and transitions.
It does not predict outcomes.
It defines **which transformations are structurally admissible**.
This canonical table generates multiple structural projections, including the Congruity Periodic Table, which organizes admissibility regimes across domains.
All subsequent applications — in biology, medicine, artificial intelligence, energy, economics, physics, or other domains —
are **projections of this table**, not modifications of it.

Nothing in this repository is domain-specific by design.
This repository **fixes the grammar**. Everything else follows.

## Status

This table is **closed at the structural level**.  
Extensions may occur only as projections, not modifications.

## Canonical Freeze

This repository defines the **closed canonical layer** of Congruity.

No changes, extensions, optimizations, or domain-specific adaptations
are permitted at this level.

All future work must occur strictly as **projections** of this grammar,
not as modifications.

This repository is final by design.

## Boundary Atlases

Explorations of admissibility boundaries, regime breakdowns, and cross-domain failure patterns are documented separately as interpretive atlases.

These materials do not define admissibility. They illustrate how admissibility violations manifest across domains, under the canonical grammar.

## Canonical Status

This repository defines the closed canonical layer of the Congruity framework.

The canonical grammar specifies:
- admissible states
- admissible transitions
- admissibility constraints

It does not:
- predict outcomes
- optimize systems
- provide empirical validation
- replace domain-specific theories

All empirical, applied, or diagnostic work must occur strictly outside this repository, as projections or interpretations of this grammar.

## Relation to Existing Frameworks (Non-Exhaustive)

Congruity is orthogonal to optimization, prediction, and control frameworks.
It defines *structural admissibility conditions* under which such frameworks may operate.

Relevant bodies of literature include:

- Complex systems constraints and phase transitions (e.g. Haken, Prigogine)
- Scaling laws and regime validity in artificial intelligence (e.g. Kaplan et al.)
- Structural constraints in biological systems and aging (e.g. López-Otín et al.)

These frameworks address performance, dynamics, or outcomes.
Congruity operates strictly at the level of admissible structure.
