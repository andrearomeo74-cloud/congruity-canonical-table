# The Canonical Table of Congruity

![Congruity Canonical Layers](assets/congruity_canonical_layers.png)

This repository defines the **canonical structural grammar of Congruity**.

Congruity is not a model, an algorithm, or an application framework.  
It is a structural law describing **admissible transformations** in complex systems.

The Canonical Table formalizes Congruity as a minimal, finite lattice of proportional states and transitions.
It does not predict outcomes.
It defines **which transformations are structurally admissible**.
This canonical table generates multiple structural projections, including the Congruity Periodic Table, which organizes admissibility regimes across domains.
All subsequent applications — in biology, medicine, artificial intelligence, energy, economics, physics, or other domains —
are **projections of this table**, not modifications of it.

Nothing in this repository is domain-specific by design.
This repository **fixes the grammar**. Everything else follows.

## Status

This table is **closed at the structural level**.  
Extensions may occur only as projections, not modifications.
