# The Canonical Table of Congruity

## Definition

The Canonical Table of Congruity is a finite structural lattice describing
all admissible proportional states of a system and the valid transitions between them.

It is not probabilistic.
It is not predictive.
It is not optimized for outcomes.

It encodes admissibility.

## The 7 Levels

Each level corresponds to a regime of proportional coherence:

1. Static congruity (baseline proportionality)
2. Local optimization under constraint
3. Systemic coherence and coupling
4. Multi-domain proportional alignment
5. Recursive stability under adaptation
6. Global constraint preservation
7. Closure under admissible transformation

Transitions between levels are directional and constrained.
Not all transitions are reversible.
Not all paths are admissible.

## Structural Properties

- Non-commutative transitions
- Boundary-defined admissibility
- Scale-invariant grammar
- Projection-compatible across domains

---

## Interpretation

The table should be read as a grammar, not as a theory.

If a proposed system, intervention, or optimization violates the table,
it may function locally while remaining structurally unstable.

Congruity does not ask whether something works.
It asks whether it is admissible.

---

## Closure

This table is structurally closed.

All further work occurs as:
- projections
- certifications
- diagnostics
- applications

The grammar itself does not expand.
