Congruity as an Admissibility Grammar
A Canonical, Pre-Operational Framework
Abstract
Congruity is introduced here as a canonical admissibility grammar: a minimal, pre-operational framework designed to determine whether a given configuration or transition is structurally admissible, independently of optimization, prediction, or performance criteria.
Unlike evaluative or goal-driven systems, Congruity does not rank outcomes, forecast trajectories, or recommend actions. Its sole function is to discriminate between admissible and non-admissible states and transitions, based on internal coherence and constraint satisfaction.
This document formalizes the canonical layer of Congruity, upon which all domain-specific implementations and projections are built.
1. Canonical States
A state is defined as a class of system configurations sharing the same structural properties with respect to admissibility.
Canonical states are:
discrete
finite (at the canonical level)
non-metric
non-optimizing
They do not encode utility, performance, or desirability.
They encode structural condition only.
A canonical state answers the question:
“Is the system in a configuration that can exist without contradiction?”
not:
“Is the system doing well?”
2. Transitions as Constraints
A transition represents a possible passage between two canonical states.
Crucially:
transitions are not actions
transitions are not causal mechanisms
transitions are constraint-gated passages
A transition exists if and only if:
it does not violate structural prerequisites
it respects ordering relations between states
it does not introduce incoherent dependencies
Thus, Congruity treats dynamics as filtered possibility, not as execution.
3. Admissibility
Admissibility is a binary property.
A state or transition is either:
admissible, or
not admissible
There are no scores, probabilities, or gradients at the canonical level.
Admissibility means:
no internal contradiction
no prerequisite violation
no forbidden jump across structural layers
Importantly:
Admissible does not mean correct, optimal, ethical, or safe.
It means only:
structurally allowable without collapse.
4. Ordering and Closure
Canonical states are partially ordered by prerequisite relations.
This induces:
a directed acyclic structure
closure under admissible composition
prohibition of backward or skipping transitions
The admissibility grammar ensures that:
any admissible path preserves structural coherence
any forbidden path is rejected immediately, locally, and deterministically
No global optimization or foresight is required.
5. Projections and Domain Tables
All domain-specific applications (e.g. biological systems, AI agents, markets, governance) are projections of the canonical grammar.
These projections may:
introduce metrics
add temporal dynamics
apply optimization
embed learning systems
However:
none of these belong to the canonical layer
none can alter admissibility rules
The canonical grammar is fixed; projections are contextual.
6. Scope and Limits
This framework explicitly does not:
predict future states
optimize behavior
guarantee safety or correctness
replace domain models
prescribe actions
Its role is strictly prior:
to define what is structurally allowed before any further reasoning occurs.
Congruity operates as a precondition layer, not as a decision engine.
Conclusion
Congruity, at the canonical level, is not a theory of action, value, or intelligence.
It is a grammar of admissibility.
By separating admissibility from evaluation, Congruity provides a stable foundation upon which diverse systems can be built, analyzed, or constrained—without entangling structural coherence with goals, incentives, or outcomes.
7.0 Relation to Existing Frameworks (Non-exhaustive)
This canonical grammar is orthogonal to:
- optimization-based models
- predictive frameworks
- domain-specific theories
It defines admissibility conditions under which those models remain valid.
