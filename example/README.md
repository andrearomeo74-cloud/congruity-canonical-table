# Minimal Admissibility Examples

This section provides minimal, non-empirical examples illustrating how Congruity
acts as an admissibility filter, not as a predictive or optimization model.

## Example 1 – Admissible Transition

A system configuration maintains proportional relationships between
capability, cost, scale, and consequence.

The transition preserves structural coherence.
Result: **Admissible**

## Example 2 – Non-Admissible Transition

A system increases capability and scale without accounting for corresponding cost
or downstream consequences.

This introduces unpriced asymmetry.
Result: **Non-Admissible**

## Notes
These examples do not evaluate performance, outcomes, or desirability.
They illustrate structural admissibility only.
