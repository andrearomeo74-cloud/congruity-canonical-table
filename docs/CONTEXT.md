# Context and Relation to Existing Frameworks

Congruity does not compete with existing theories or models.
It defines the structural conditions under which such theories remain admissible.

## Optimization and Scaling Laws
Classical optimization frameworks and AI scaling laws (e.g. loss-based or parameter-based scaling)
describe performance trends.
Congruity operates orthogonally: it determines whether a configuration or transition is structurally admissible
before optimization occurs.

## Aging and Biological Hallmarks
Biological frameworks such as aging hallmarks or epigenetic clocks describe downstream manifestations of systemic degradation.
Congruity addresses a prior layer: loss of proportionality and admissibility preceding observable decline.

## Gravity and Cosmology
Alternative gravity and emergent gravity theories address explanatory gaps in dynamics.
Congruity does not modify dynamics; it classifies which structural configurations are admissible
before any dynamical law is applied.

## Intelligence and Agency
Cognitive and AI models explain behavior, learning, or decision-making.
Congruity precedes agency: it constrains which state transitions are allowed
independently of goals, reward, or optimization.
